I am Luis Cano, an Engineering student in Computer Science at the Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM). My main research interests include AI, Deep Learning, and data analytics. However, I am also knowledgeable of game/app development, web development, digital marketing, and multiple programming languages. I seek self-learning of these fields and am driven by looking forward to make innovative products and solutions with positive impacts in the world.

Currently work as a Digital Analyst, Web Developer, and SEO Analyst at [Forte Industria](https://forteindustria.com/) —an online retailer of industrial machinery. Working aswell in other digital related future projects. In this area, also have previous experience working at [Pixelwork](https://pixelwork.mx/) — designing and making multiple sites for other companies, working with SEO and mantaining multiple domains.

Moreover, I have worked in app development –working with Unity to develop UI/UX layouts as well as game features and mechanics, with react.js for creating web apps, and with AndroidStudio for developing apps for android devices. Have also worked with neural networks and deep learning to implement prediction and clasification solutions. As well, I have succesfully completed multiple projects with work ranging from developing apps, APIs, AI, web pages, databases, games, software, and project planning and design.
On these projects I have successfully worked in teams, communicating my ideas and leading the team where needed, while also valuing the different points of view of my teammates and learning from the insight of others.

Furthermore, I am experienced as well in teaching –having taught programming courses (of *Swift*) for younger students in two occasions.
